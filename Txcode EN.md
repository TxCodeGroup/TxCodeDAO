### TxCode Community – Group  

TxCode community is committed to providing a platform for knowledge sharing and learning for the worldwide blockchain developers..

 

### TxCode Weapons  

The developing connector of Ethereum is a standard of a single chain, which focused on its development weapons.   

Simply, less is more. 

Creating an all-in-one handbook. 

Technology stack: web3.js, ethers.js, hardhat, truffle, solidity 

The all-in-one handbook has two sections: tutorial sections and projects parts. The tutorial sections  will focus on the study of blockchain’s fundamental knowledge and smart contract. The project sections  mainly focused on the research and analysis of the mainstream of Defi, NFT, and DAO, which help the developer emphasize practical uses based on the blockchain’s technology.

3. ERC20 extension: vote, WETH packaging, flexible supply, linearization release 

4. Financial contract: time lock, pledge, batchtransfer, fund-raised transaction

 

### All-in-one HandBook - Project 

The project section prioritizes those who are fundamental developers and good at analysis and filter the advanced code review. 

 

Based on sharing’s within the TxCode community, the group cooperates mode will help to expand the test nets. Developers can initiate the project within the group and then cooperate furthermore.

 

### Join Us:

\- Adding TxCode WeChat (**WeChat ID: TxCodeGroup**) and apply to join the normal developer group chats.

\- The normal developer group will share or meet at least once a week. (**WeChat ID: kefuleer)**. All members could initiate some topic to the group and share this relevant topic once the subject has been selected and chosen.

\- Sharing topic: analyze based on the current blockchain industry cases. Preferred method: PPT, which is easy to form in the document and share with the members 

\- Information-sharing meetings include an ***\*industrial discussion\**** ***\*me\*******\*e\*******\*t\*******\*ings\**** and ***\*technology-based sharing meetings\****. The sessions will be held at Tencent Conference. 

\- The DAO study group could also hold information-sharing meetings, which need to sign up from WeChat (WeChat ID: kefuleer) and be organized by the community.

\- All information-sharing meetings will be posted and shared with the members..

 

### DAO Organization 

1. The members who contribute a Pull-Request (shown as PR) once or follow TxCode on WeChat and contribute  a source or video will be invited to advanced developer groups.

2. The members will be promoting to Tx-Evaluator for those who contribute three times high-quailed shared information.

3. Tx-Evaluator can apply group study from WeChat (WeChat ID: kefuleer) and help members to complete their project study

4. Tx-Evaluators need to share PR or technology-shared information at least once every two weeks; otherwise, the authority as an evaluator will be removed and fall to advanced Tx developers. The promotion process remains the same if the developers want to be promoted as Tx-Evaluators. 

 

### DAO Learning Group

The study groups’ researches are based on Defi, DAO, NFT, and so on. 

1.	The developer who submits at least one PR or technology-based information can join the study group  

2.	The study group members should have clear distribution and share their results weekly 

3.	DAO volunteers (**WeChat ID: kefuleer**) are welcome to sign up and join the study group to help group members to finish the learning targets of the group.

4.	All study results will be shared with all communities’ members 

 

 

### Group learning outcomes: 

1. White book: shared TxCode video lectures

2. Contract: codes, docs, TxCode video lectures

3. H5: codes, docs, TxCode video lectures
